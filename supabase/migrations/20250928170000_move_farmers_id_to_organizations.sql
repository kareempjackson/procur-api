-- Migration: Move farmers_id from users to organizations as TEXT
-- Safe to run multiple times due to IF EXISTS / IF NOT EXISTS guards

-- 1) Add column to organizations
ALTER TABLE organizations
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS farmers_id TEXT;

-- 2) Migrate existing data from users -> organizations (if any)
--    Uses any linked user record's farmers_id for its organization
UPDATE organizations o
SET farmers_id = s.farmers_id
FROM (
  SELECT ou.organization_id, MAX(u.farmers_id) AS farmers_id
  FROM organization_users ou
  JOIN users u ON u.id = ou.user_id
  WHERE u.farmers_id IS NOT NULL AND u.farmers_id <> ''
  GROUP BY ou.organization_id
) AS s
WHERE o.id = s.organization_id
  AND (o.farmers_id IS NULL OR o.farmers_id = '');

-- 3) Drop column from users
ALTER TABLE users
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS farmers_id;
